# Database Project

This is a music streaming service database I projected for a university group project, using PostgreSQL.

- Table creation can be found at [ddl.sql](ddl.sql)
- Trigger creation can be found at [triggers.sql](triggers.sql)
- View creation can be found at [view.sql](view.sql)
- Not that accurate and kind of small set of data we generated using Chat GPT can be found at [sample_data.sql](sample_data.sql)
- 10 queries we made can be found at [queries.sql](queries.sql)
